## Technologies Used

---

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React Context, JavaScript

I choose to use `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup.
For managing time, I choose [day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) because of the bundle size and functionalities allowed.

Another small library used was [react-datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/) so the date picker when creating a new reminder works and looks the same in all browsers.

### Public APIS used

[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and [Mapbox Geocoding API](https://www.mapbox.com/) to get the weather forecast and the coordinates most approximate coordinates to the city selected by the user.

## Challenges

---

This was a 5 day challenge project.

One of the main challenges I ran into was using context to manage states and testing, this lead me to spend a few days on a research, at the end using React Context and Hooks to manage states made it easier to implement.

The other challenge was implementing tests, to accomplish this I tried using integration testing because of a better coverage of the functionality.
